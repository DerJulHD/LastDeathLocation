## 🗒️ Description
This **datapack** for Minecraft Java Edition gives you the possibility to display your "Last Death Location" after death in the chat. It displays the **coordinates**, the **dimension (mod compatible)** and creates a particle cuboid. The gamerule "doImmediateRespawn" must be disabled. If not, it will be disabled during installation and re-enabled after uninstallation. This datapack is somewhat a **cheat**, so be sure you want to use it. Otherwise use the Recovery Compass (vanilla item) instead of the datapack.
