## 🗒️ Description
"Last Death Location" is a data pack for Minecraft Java Edition that allows players to view recent death locations. These locations can be accessed via the menu. The history in the menu can store up to 16 recent deaths. The data pack also offers several options to customize the player's experience. As there is no need for a "Recovery Compass" to view the last death location, some may consider this data pack as a form of **cheat**.

## ✨ Features
- Displaying your last death location, including coordinates and dimension.
- Maintaining a history of your 16 most recent death locations, each marked with the corresponding in-game day.
- Creating a cuboid marker at your death position.
- Providing a teleport command for a recent death location that can be easily copied to the chat.

## ⌨️ Commands
- `/trigger -deathlocation`: Displays the most recent death location.
- `/trigger -deathhistory`: Displays the death history.
- `/trigger -deathsettings`: Opens the settings menu.
- `/trigger -deathmenu`: Opens the data pack-wide menu.

## 🚀 Functions
- `/function ldl:_clear_histories`: Clears the death history for all players.
- `/function ldl:_reset_settings`: Resets the settings for all players (restores default values).
- `/function ldl:_remove_cuboids`: Removes all currently chunk-loaded cuboids.
- `/function ldl:_uninstall`: Removes all scoreboards, data storage, and loaded entities of the data pack.

## 🌍 Languages
"Last Death Location" does not natively support languages other than **English**. If you wish to use this data pack in your own language, you can create a custom resource pack that utilizes translation keys.
