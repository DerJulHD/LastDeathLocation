## üóíÔ∏è Description
"Last Death Location" is a datapack for Minecraft Java Edition that allows players to view recent death locations. These locations can be accessed via the menu. The history in the menu can store up to 16 recent deaths. The datapack also offers several options to customize the player's experience. As there is no need for a "Recovery Compass" to view the last death location, some may consider this datapack as a form of **cheat**.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Commands
- `/trigger -deathlocation`: Displays the most recent death location.
- `/trigger -deathhistory`: Displays the death history.
- `/trigger -deathsettings`: Opens the settings menu.
- `/trigger -deathmenu`: Opens the datapack-wide menu.

## üöÄ Functions
- `/function ldl:_clear_histories`: Clears the death history for all players.
- `/function ldl:_reset_settings`: Resets the settings for all players (restores default values).
- `/function ldl:_remove_cuboids`: Removes all currently chunk-loaded cuboids.
- `/function ldl:_uninstall`: Removes all scoreboards, data storage, and loaded entities of the datapack.

## üåç Languages
"Last Death Location" does not natively support languages other than English. If you wish to use this datapack in your own language, you can create a custom resourcepack that utilizes translation keys. A more in-depth explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/fixyldev/LastDeathLocation/wiki/Languages).
